# Gatsby's Blog Starter + Slices

This starter is used as a simple demo site showing how to use the [Gatsby Slice API](https://v5.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-slice).

It's part of Gatsby 5, visit the [Gatsby 5 Umbrella Discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/36609).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-slices https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-partial-hydration-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-starter-slices
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `gatsby-starter-slices` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
